Tutorials and descriptions on how to setup the components of an i4Trust data space.

[i4Trust](https://i4trust.org/) is a common framework used for creating collaborative dataspaces based on [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/)
and [iSHARE](https://dev.ishareworks.org/index.html). Data is passed between context brokers using the 
[NGSI-LD data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGSI-LD) format, and protected using distributed trust mechanisms, meaning that a permission 
chain of _"who gives access to what"_ is set up between the  various participants within the dataspace. Individual clients of the particpants
do not need to be preregistered, but can be vouched for by an existing participant who has already registered a digital certificate created by a Certificate Authority.
